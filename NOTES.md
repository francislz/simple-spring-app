## Plans

- [x] Setup project (Gradle, SpringBoot)
- [x] Add swagger for API testing and usage
- [] Implement logic to read data from the csv files
- [] Implement generic search functionality
    - Option 1: Simple search on a list using string matching (Less efficient, but we don´t have much data so not an issue)
    - Option 2: Create a Data Structure such as a suffix tree to optimize the search to support scalability (better search but can be memory intensive if the data scales a lot)
    - Option 3: Load everything into a SQLite, index the columns used in the search and let the DB handle the search
    - Option 4: Group the data using a Hash and do a linear search on the group, this allows us to avoid search the entire dataset in this particular case.
- Implement best match using the search algorithm and the parameters
- Implement sort logic

### Find the best-matched restaurants (Requirements)
You have data about local restaurants located near your company, which you can find in the **restaurants.csv** file. You would like to develop a basic search function that allows your colleagues to search those restaurants to help them find where they would like to have lunch. The search is based on five criteria: **Restaurant Name, Customer Rating(1 star ~ 5 stars), Distance(1 mile ~ 10 miles), Price(how much one person will spend on average, $10 ~ $50), Cuisine(Chinese, American, Thai, etc.).** The requirements are listed below.

1. The function should allow users to provide up to five parameters based on the criteria listed above. *You can assume each parameter can contain only one value.*
2. If parameter values are invalid, return an error message.
3. The function should return up to five matches based on the provided criteria. If no matches are found, return an empty list. If less than 5 matches are found, return them all. If more than 5 matches are found, return the best 5 matches. The returned results should be sorted according to the rules explained below. Every record in the search results should at least contain the restaurant name.
4. “Best match” is defined as below:
   - A Restaurant Name match is defined as an exact or partial String match with what users provided. For example, “Mcd” would match “Mcdonald’s”.
   - A Customer Rating match is defined as a Customer Rating equal to or more than what users have asked for. For example, “3” would match all the 3 stars restaurants plus all the 4 stars and 5 stars restaurants.
   - A Distance match is defined as a Distance equal to or less than what users have asked for. For example, “2” would match any distance that is equal to or less than 2 miles from your company.
   - A Price match is defined as a Price equal to or less than what users have asked for. For example, “15” would match any price that is equal to or less than $15 per person.
   - A Cuisine match is defined as an exact or partial String match with what users provided. For example, “Chi” would match “Chinese”. You can find all the possible Cuisines in the **cuisines.csv** file. *You can assume each restaurant offers only one cuisine.*
   - The five parameters are holding an “AND” relationship. For example, if users provide Name = “Mcdonald’s” and Distance = 2, you should find all “Mcdonald’s” within 2 miles.
   - When multiple matches are found, you should sort them as described below.
     - Sort the restaurants by Distance first.
     - After the above process, if two matches are still equal, then the restaurant with a higher customer rating wins.
     - After the above process, if two matches are still equal, then the restaurant with a lower price wins.
     - After the above process, if two matches are still equal, then you can randomly decide the order.
     - Example: if the input is Customer Rating = 3 and Price = 15. Mcdonald’s is 4 stars with an average spend = $10, and it is 1 mile away. And KFC is 3 stars with an average spend = $8, and it is 1 mile away. Then we should consider Mcdonald’s as a better match than KFC. (They both matches the search criteria -> we compare distance -> we get a tie -> we then compare customer rating -> Mcdonald’s wins)
5. The final submitted work should include a README file. No UI is required in this assessment, but you may implement one if you would like. **The steps to run and test your program should be clearly introduced in the README file.** If you have made any additional **Assumptions** besides what we have listed above while working on this assessment, please document them so that we can better understand your solution.
